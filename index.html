                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Khaled Hosseini was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1965. His father was a diplomat in the Afghan Foreign Ministry and his mother taught Farsi and history at a high school in Kabul. In 1976, the Foreign Ministry relocated the Hosseini family to Paris. They were ready to return to Kabul in 1980, but by then their homeland had witnessed a bloody communist coup and the invasion of the Soviet Army. The Hosseinis sought and were granted political asylum in the United States, and in September 1980 moved to San Jose, California. Hosseini graduated from high school in 1984 and enrolled at Santa Clara University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1988. The following year he entered the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, where he earned a medical degree in 1993. He completed his residency at Cedars-Sinai medical center in Los Angeles and was a practicing internist between 1996 and 2004. In March 2001, while practicing medicine, Hosseini began writing his first novel, The Kite Runner, which was published by Riverhead Books in 2003. That debut went on to launch one of the biggest literary careers of our time. Today, Khaled Hosseini is one of the most recognized and bestselling authors in the world. His books, The Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns, and And the Mountains Echoed, have been published in over seventy countries and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. In 2006 Khaled was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency. Inspired by a trip he made to Afghanistan with the UNHCR, he later established The Khaled Hosseini Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, which provides humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan. He lives in Northern California with his wife and two children.

                    <h3 class="card-title">Kite Runner</h3>
                    <p>The Kite Runner, written by Khaled Hosseini, tells the extraordinary story of an unlikely friendship between a wealthy Afghan boy, named Amir, and Hassan, the son of his father’s servant — who he later finds out, after Hassan’s death, has always been his half-brother. The novel is set in Kabul, Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion in 1978, and depicts life in a nation that is in the process of being ravaged and destroyed. It is about the harshness of violence and rape; the power of education; the price of betrayal and the struggle for redemption; and the power fathers have over their sons. An unforgettably inspiring story of family, love, salvation, and friendship told against the devastating backdrop of the history of Afghanistan over the last thirty years, The Kite Runner is a powerful novel that has become an instant classic.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">A Thousand Splendid suns</h3>
                    <p>A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khalid Hosseini is a historical fiction telling a haunting, heartbreaking, and compelling tale of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love. The book tells the love story of Laila and Tariq, the story of Mariam’s sacrifice, and the story of cruelty and violence of Rasheed. The plot of A Thousand Splendid Suns weaves the turbulent events of Afghanistan’s last thirty years—from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to the post-Taliban reconstruction through an intensely captivating tale of family, friendship, and hope. The book unfolds a powerful story of two generations of women brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives become inextricable from the history playing out around them. </p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">And The Mountains Echoed</h3>
                    <p>An unforgettable novel about finding a lost piece of yourself in someone else. Khaled Hosseini, the #1 New York Times–bestselling author of The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, has written a new novel about how we love, how we take care of one another, and how the choices we make resonate through generations. In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globe—from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of Tinos—the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.

                    <h3 class="card-title">Sea Prayer</h3>
                    <p>A short, powerful, illustrated book written by beloved novelist Khaled Hosseini in response to the current refugee crisis, Sea Prayer is composed in the form of a letter, from a father to his son, on the eve of their journey. Watching over his sleeping son, the father reflects on the dangerous sea-crossing that lies before them. It is also a vivid portrait of their life in Homs, Syria, before the war, and of that city's swift transformation from a home into a deadly war zone. Impelled to write this story by the haunting image of young Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body washed up on the beach in Turkey in September 2015, Hosseini hopes to pay tribute to the millions of families, like Kurdi's, who have been splintered and forced from home by war and persecution, and he will donate author proceeds from this book to the UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency) and The Khaled Hosseini Foundation to help fund lifesaving relief efforts to help refugees around the globe.</p>
